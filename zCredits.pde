/*
  "Doniol" - TDI Club forum member who produced the original version of this gauge. My efforts are
    designed around his work and I aim to match his quality.
  Jermey Mercado - Friend who inspired me to produce the gauge. He owned a Doniol gauge and let me play
    around with it and have a look at how it worked.
  Michael O'Brien - This is I, the author of the current gauge. As I said above I aim to match the
    quality of the work that was previously produced. I feel I can even round off a few rough corners of
    the original design and add additional functionality. Through the help of the internet, I've
    barrowed some code (credit was given) and brushed up on my electronics knowledge base. I'm no pro
    but if I can improve something, I might as well try.
  Paul Tufano - Friend of a friend, but a friend anyhow. Helped test my prototypes and code feedback.
  Colleen Boyle - Close friend and constant encouragement for finishing the project despite various parts
    being over my head by a long shot.
  Greg Lyman -
